    . Right click on Hollow Knight 
    . Click on properties 
    . Click on Local Files 
    . Click on browse
Second find where the C# Assembly is

    . When you in the local files of the game go into hollow_knight_Data
    . Go into Managed
Now you should see a file called Assembly-CSharp.dll. When you see this file you know you're in the right place.

This is where you want to take the file Assembly-CSharp.dll from this folder and put it into the folder you are on.

It should give you couple of options when moving the file in you.

You want to click replace file.

Now when you run the game the new changes should be saved, and you can try out the Mod.

    . Right click on Hollow Knight 
    . Click on properties 
    . Click on Local Files
